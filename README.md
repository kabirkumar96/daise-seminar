# DAISE Seminar

This repo was part of a Seminar Project titled "Forecasting German day-ahead electricity prices - A validation of the importance of considering market integration".

In this project we tried to implement [this](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1708.07061) paper by Jesus Lago. We studied effects on Germany's day-ahead electricity price forecasts when a model is trained with and without Austrian electricity data.
